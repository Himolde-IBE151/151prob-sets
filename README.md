Notice that:
-  The board status is stored in a 3x3 list. Every line in the list start in 0, last line is 2. Same is valid for the columns.
- Possible positions in the board are [0][0], [2][2], [1][0], etc
- The user enters the position ex. as: 0, 0
- You can change the way the user give the position to the program. Change the split() parameter to the character you like (ex. split(",") allows the entry as 0,0, split() allows the entry as 0 0)
